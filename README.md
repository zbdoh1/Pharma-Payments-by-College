**Supplementary Methods**

Data on payments to health professionals from November 2019 to October 2024 were downloaded from the centralised Medicines Australia repository. (1) These reports include individual payment records with fields for company name, practitioner name, healthcare professional type, practice address, service type, event type, payment recipient, registration fees, travel costs, fees for service, and reporting period. These data were merged with legacy reports (October 2015–October 2019) obtained from the University of Sydney repository. (2)

To assign each doctor to a specialty, a manual search of the AHPRA Register of Practitioners was performed. (3) When an exact match was unclear, for example, for common names shared by multiple clinicians, additional verification was undertaken using hospital or clinic websites, conference speaker biographies, and other publicly available sources. In some cases practitioners held more than one specialty; to avoid double-counting, each individual was assigned a single primary specialty, determined through targeted online searches. Further details on the database construction are available elsewhere. (4)

Each clinician’s primary specialty was then mapped to the relevant specialist college using the list of approved programs of study from AHPRA. (5) For example, a practitioner registered as a Specialist in Anaesthesia was assigned to the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists. The full list of specialties and corresponding colleges is provided in Table S1. Some specialties require dual fellowship; for the purposes of this analysis the following allocations were applied:

- Haematology - RACP
- Microbiology - RACP
- Immunology/Allergy - RACP

For each specialty we estimated pharmaceutical company reach (the proportion of registered clinicians in each specialty who received ≥ 1 payment) by linking payments to AHPRA 2023/24 workforce counts. (6) The number of specialists in each speciality at the end of the study period was used to calculate proportions. This provides the most conservative estimate of pharmaceutical company reach. Proportions and 95% Wilson Confidence Intervals were calculated for Figure 1. In the first part of Figure 1 College level results were presented, next specialties under the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (RACS) were analysed individually.

Formal data analysis was undertaken by M.F. and Z.D. using R version 4.4.2, with independent checking by T.L. Visualisation was completed by Z.D. All code and data are available at: https://github.com/zbdoh1/Pharma-Payments-by-College). The released analysis dataset excludes practitioner address fields to protect privacy, as some individuals listed personal rather than professional addresses. The University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee determined the study to be exempt from review because it used publicly available data. This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.
